  <p>
    Image analysis or imagery analysis is the extraction of meaningful
    information from images; mainly from digital images by means of digital
    image processing techniques.

    Image analysis tasks can be as simple as reading bar coded tags or as
    sophisticated as identifying a person from their face.
